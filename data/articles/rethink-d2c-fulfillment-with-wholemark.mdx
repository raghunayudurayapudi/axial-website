Consumers are no longer walking into physical stores to shop for their desired products. It has now become a common practice to shop online. 

The volume of online orders being placed is massive. In 2020, **131.2 billion parcels** were shipped globally. This translates to a shipment of **4160 parcels per second**<Reference url={'https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005317/en/Global-Parcel-Volume-Exceeds-131-Billion-in-2020-up-27-Percent-Year-Over-Year-Finds-Pitney-Bowes-Parcel-Shipping-Index'} />. In 2021, the volume reached 155 billion parcels<Reference url={'https://www.pitneybowes.com/content/dam/pitneybowes/us/en/shipping-index/parcel-shipping-index-ebook.pdf'} /> and is expected to grow higher in successive years.

With the increasing affiliation towards online shopping, consumers are also shifting their shopping preferences towards D2C brands. It has been recorded that **55% of online shoppers** prefer to **order directly from brands**<Reference url={'https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/new-research-shows-a-good-brand-website-is-more-im.html'}/>. This is largely due to the seamless shopping experience offered by D2C brands. 

Direct to Consumer (D2C/DTC) brands are those that sell products to consumers without intermediaries such as wholesalers or retailers. Through direct interactions, D2C brands collect data and generate actionable insights that translate into providing exclusive experience for each customer. 

A critical attribute considered by most customers when shopping online from a D2C brand is the delivery time. The inability of a brand to fulfill orders within a short time period leads to loss of customers and drop in sales. Surveys conducted among online shoppers have shown that **17% of consumers stop shopping** from a brand after **receiving a late delivery one time** and **55% of consumers stop shopping** from a brand after **receiving a late delivery two to three times**<Reference url={'https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/14912-impact-of-late-or-inaccurate-deliveries-can-be-disastrous-study-shows'} />. 

The fulfillment of an ecommerce order by a D2C brand involves last mile delivery of the order to customer and if the need occurs, managing return of the order. The greatest challenge for a D2C business is scaling up fulfillment processes to keep up with the growing volume of orders. **8 out of 10 online stores** get **abandoned within 24 months** due to their **inability to scale up**<Reference url={'https://www.invespcro.com/blog/what-causes-dtc-ecommerce-brands-to-fail/'} />.

Collaborating with a 3PL (Third-Party Logistic service) or Ecommerce fulfillment partner adds value to D2C ecommerce businesses and their customers by enhancing customer service, minimizing operation costs and providing room for scalability.
